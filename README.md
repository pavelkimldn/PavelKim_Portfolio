# Projects

#### Below are some of the projects I have developed. For detailed descriptions, reports, and access to the code, please click on the project titles, which will direct you to the respective GitHub repositories.repo.

**[Project 1: S&P 500 Data Visualisation](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Data_Visualisation_S-P500_2022)**

- Analyze financial metrics of S&P 500 companies to understand sector-wise distributions and investment implications.
- Dataset includes 14 columns with financial metrics like price, PE ratio, dividend yield, EPS, 52-week highs/lows, market cap, EBITDA, PS, and PB.
- Used histograms, scatter plots, box plots, 3D scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize data and interpret relationships.
- Found stock price concentrations, price-EPS relationships, and sectoral dividend yield variations, with Telecommunication Services showing the highest median yield.
- Visualizations help investors make informed decisions by highlighting sector differences, aiding in identifying growth, stability, or income opportunities.

**[Project 2: Emotion Detection with Computer Vision](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Computer_Vision_Live_Emotion_Detection)**

- Provide companies with a valuable tool for enhancing various operations, particularly during business meetings.
- Enable recording of video footage or live emotion detection during meetings to gauge overall mood and sentiment.
- Assist managers in accurately assessing meeting success based on detected emotions.
- Evaluate team members' performance by analyzing emotional responses during interactions.
- Extend utility by integrating the model into existing CCTV systems for real-time emotion detection among employees.
- Serve as a versatile tool for enhancing decision-making processes, fostering better communication, and optimizing workplace dynamics.

**[Project 3: Cyber Security Port Scanner](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Cyber_Security_Port_Scanner)**

- Develope a simple port scanner to identify open ports on a given IP address range.
- Port Scanner assists in network security assessments by discovering potential vulnerabilities.
- Port scanner scans a specified range of ports on a given IP address.
- Logs scanning results for analysis.
- Simulated scanning multiple IP addresses to generate comprehensive data.

**[Project 4: Predicting Luxury Watch Prices with an MLP model](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Luxury_Watches_MLP)**

- Compare K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for AAPL closing price prediction.
- Preprocess data: Select features, split dataset, and scale features.
- Train models: KNN with 5 neighbors, SVM with linear kernel.
- Evaluate models: Compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and perform cross-validation.
- Visualize results: Plot actual vs predicted prices, error distribution histograms, scatter plots, and learning curves.
