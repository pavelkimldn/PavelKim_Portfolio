# Pavel's Portfolio

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Pavel Kim
#### I am an aspiring Data Scientist
I have completed my Bachelors degree in Economics at UCL. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters degree in Data Science at City University. 

Skills: Python 3/ C++/ AI/ Machine Learning/ Big Data/ Relational Databases

[Project 1: Predicting Luxury Watch Prices with an MLP model](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Luxury_Watches_MLP)
- Compare K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for AAPL closing price prediction.
- Preprocess data: Select features, split dataset, and scale features.
- Train models: KNN with 5 neighbors, SVM with linear kernel.
- Evaluate models: Compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and perform cross-validation.
- Visualize results: Plot actual vs predicted prices, error distribution histograms, scatter plots, and learning curves.
