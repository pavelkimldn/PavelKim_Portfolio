[Project 1: Predicting Luxury Watch Prices with an MLP model](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Luxury_Watches_MLP)
- Compare K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for AAPL closing price prediction.
- Preprocess data: Select features, split dataset, and scale features.
- Train models: KNN with 5 neighbors, SVM with linear kernel.
- Evaluate models: Compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and perform cross-validation.
- Visualize results: Plot actual vs predicted prices, error distribution histograms, scatter plots, and learning curves.

[Project 2: Emotion Detection with Computer Vision](https://github.com/pavelkimldn/Luxury_Watches_MLP)

Provide companies with a valuable tool for enhancing various operations, particularly during business meetings.
Enable recording of video footage or live emotion detection during meetings to gauge overall mood and sentiment.
Assist managers in accurately assessing meeting success based on detected emotions.
Evaluate team members' performance by analyzing emotional responses during interactions.
Extend utility by integrating the model into existing CCTV systems for real-time emotion detection among employees.
Serve as a versatile tool for enhancing decision-making processes, fostering better communication, and optimizing workplace dynamics.
